# Simple HTML Dom Parser

**Abandoned**
I'm now using: [a3gz/php-dom-parser](https://github.com/a3gz/php-dom-parser) which version 1.0.0 is the same as this package up until the moment I abandoned it.


In this fork of [Sunra's Simple PHP DOM Parser](https://github.com/sunra/php-simple-html-dom-parser) I took the orignal code an re-organized it in separate classes. I also changed the namespace structure to something more convenient.

I also removed the demo application that simply doesn't work with this package.
